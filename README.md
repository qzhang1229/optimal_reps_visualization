# optimal_reps_visualization

This repository creates a visualization to the result of the optimal representatives in python. In addition, it provides some helper functions, including converting a point cloud to a distance matrix and visualizing a simplex barcode. To run the program, you need to install python and some other supporting libraries. We will go through some instructions for installing these things first.

## Install Python

Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3104/. Choose a correct version of installer to download. Then, use the installer to install python on your computer. Now we need to add python to the system variable of your computer. You can do that by choosing to do so in the installation process. There is a check box that asks you whether you'd like to add it to the PATH. Check the box and it will automatically add python to the list of system variables. Even if you forget to check the box, you can still do that by following this instruction https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/ for Windows or this instruction  https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-add-python-to-the-path-variable-in-mac for Mac. 

## Install NumPy, matplotlib and opencv

In this repository, we uses these three libraries to do some computation and visualization. To install NumPy, open a terminal and run the following command: `pip install numpy`. To install matplotlib, use the command `pip install matplotlib`. To install opencv, use the command `pip install opencv-python`.
